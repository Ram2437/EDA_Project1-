Currently i am working with classification and regression algorithms in ML, Wherein my end goal is to implement each ML algorithms on any of the datasets in online
Classification - Logistic Regression,Decision Tree,Naive Bayes, K- Nearest Neighbour and support vector classifier
Regression - Linear, Random Forest, Desion Tree
